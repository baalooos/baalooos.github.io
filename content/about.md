Hi, Iâ€™m Charles-Edouard, \
a seasoned DevOps professional with over a decade of experience in cloud technologies. I specialize in designing and managing robust infrastructures on platforms like AWS and Scaleway. When Iâ€™m not automating workflows or containerizing applications, Iâ€™m probably climbing a rock wall or playing the trumpet! ðŸŽº
